# Iris-Classification

## Problem Statement
- This is a dataset that contains 150 rows of data about different species of Iris flowers. There is an equal number of rows for each species. 

- The purpose of this analysis is to create a model to accurately predict the species based on the petals and sepals. 

## Data Dictionary

| Column Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **sepal_length** | Length of the sepal of the flower (cm).                          |
| **sepal_width**  | Width of the sepal of the flower (cm).                           |
| **petal_length** | Length of the petal of the flower (cm).                          |
| **petal_width**  | Width of the petal of the flower (cm).                           |
| **species**      | Species of the iris flower (setosa, versicolor, virginica). |
